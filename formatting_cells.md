##Aligning Cell Content

There are several options for aligning content of a cell:

There are also two more options for cell content displaying:

Text Wrap - allows breaking a long text into several lines. Text wraps automatically to fit the column width 



Cells Merging - this option is presented in detail below.



## Merging Cells 

Cells merging allows you to combine several cells into one large cell. Thus, you can add 
a common header for several columns. Have a look at the example below:

 

Here cells A1-F1 are merged into one cell to add a common label Report - July 2016 to describe data in the rows 2-5.

To merge several adjacent cells to create a common header:

1. Copy data from the cells you want to merge into some other place on the sheet, since it will be deleted after merging.

2. Select the cells and click the Merge button:

 

3. Double-click the new big cell and type the desired text.

In case, you need to split the cells back, just click the button for a second time. The content of the merged cell will be moved into the top left cell.
