- Vertical alignment: **Top align/Middle align/Bottom align**

## Merging Cells 

Cells merging allows you to combine neighboring cells into one large cell.

For example, you can add a common header for several columns. Have a look at the example below:

![Table Header](img/merging_cells.png) 

Here cells A1-F1 are merged to add a common label *Report - July 2016* to describe data in the rows 2-5.

To merge several adjacent cells to create a common header, you need to:

1. Copy data from the cells you want to merge into some other place on the sheet, since it will be deleted after merging. 

2. Select the necessary cells and click the **Merge** button.

3. Double-click the new big cell and type the desired text.

4. Apply *Center align* to the cell to center the text.

To split the cells back, just click the button for a second time. The content of the merged cell will be moved into the top left cell.
