## Working with Charts

### Specifying Data for Charts

In order to display data in a chart you should specify the source of the cells for it. There are 2 ways to do it:

1\) Type the range of cells you want to get data from in the **Range** field:

![Range Field](.gitbook/assets/chart_range.png)

You can also define the left column as the X-axis or/and the top row as the legend, by checking the corresponding checkboxes.

**Note** that the range values are case-sensitive and must be in the upper-case.

2\) Put the cursor in the **Range** field and then select the area of the cells you want to get data from. The range will be calculated automatically:

### Working with Series

Roughly speaking all default chart types can be divided into two groups:

1. Linear (*Line, Spline, Spline Area, Area, Bar, and Radar*)
2. Circular (*Pie and Donut*)

You can work with a separate series of the linear charts.

In the **Series** tab you can:

1. Specify the range for a series 
2. Choose an appropriate color from a color picker
3. Enable or disable tooltips for markers
4. Define the markers shape 
5. Delete a series or add a new line

#### Tuning Legend

To define the data source for the legend you should provide the range of the cells to get data from in the **Range** field.

It is also possible to specify the *horizontal* and *vertical alignment* of the legend via the corresponding controls.

#### Tuning Axes

To define the data source for the X-axis type the range of the cells to get data from in the traditional **Range** field.

You can also provide *titles* for both X and Y-axes, enable the *background grid* and choose its *color* through the corresponding controls on the panel.
